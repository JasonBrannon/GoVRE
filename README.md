# So What's the Status Here?

> What's happening to GoVRE?

Since VRE (Virginia Rail Express) has released an offical Mobile app which includes ticket purchasing, GoVRE will become irrelevant over time.  However, I'm making GoVRE open source to provide a community supported alternative.

> Is there an iOS version?

I started a Swift version of GoVRE, but squashed the development after learning of the new VRE App.  Fill free to begin this effort if you'd like.

> How can I help?
